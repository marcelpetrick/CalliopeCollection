Small helper with configureable timer and servo to lift the teabag out of the pot without any further instructions.
When started, it is set to 3 min. By pressing A it increasses by one until turnover at 10 (back to 1).
Start with B.

# Bonus #
With A+B: special mode for setting the height: up/down. then saving start and end. So that the amount of turns is known. default values will life at least 2 teabab-heights.
Hint: maybe interfacing via pins is easier than multiplexing the buttons ..
