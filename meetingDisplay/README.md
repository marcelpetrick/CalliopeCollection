# meeting display

Simple 'app' to show if I am available or not.
Start the Calliope, press button A to cycle through the states (meeting, music, available).
Shown marquee text and the led-color changes accordingly.

Nothing fancy, but useful because else colleagues wonder if you "just" work and listen to music or attend a meeting.
